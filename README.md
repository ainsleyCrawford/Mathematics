# Mathematics
This console application holds manifold functions that each enact a mathematical phenomenon. The user is invited to input arguments. The current build contains methods for Fibonacci's sequence, prime numbers, triangular numbers and factorials.  
The objectives of this project are twofold: to improve by problem-solving ability and my knowledge of C#.
