# Mathematics
This console application holds manifold functions that each enact a mathematical phenomenon. The user is invited to input arguments. The current build contains methods for the Fibonacci sequence, prime numbers, triangular numbers and factorials.  
The objectives of this project are twofold: to improve by problem-solving ability and my knowledge of C#.

## The Fibonacci Sequence
### Description
The Fibonacci sequence, one of the most well-known mathematical formulae, is formed by, beginning with the numbers 0 and 1, continually adding the sum of the two preceding numbers to the sequence. This gives the following: 
> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, ad infinitum.

The Fibonacci sequence may be observed in nature. For instance hurricanes and the shape of human faces follow the rule. Applications of the sequence includes music, architecture and, interestingly for us, Agile. In the latter, Agile-team members choose a Fibonacci number from 1 to 21 to estimate either the time or effort required for a user story.
